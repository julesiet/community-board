## Notes

This was one of my more formal undertakings of ReactJS and furthermore into HTML + CSS, since I dealt with flex containers and items for the first time - but that was the bulk of it! Understanding and utilizing React in this project was basic but very useful and intuitive (and I got a cute little project for myself out of it!)
